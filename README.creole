= Basic Twitter Wall

== Description

This is a basic twitter wall that will use the streaming API to collect tweets. The last 10 tweets
will be shown on the screen. If there's a media file attached to the tweet it will be downloaded as
well and will be shown in the background.

=== Twitter API Keys

You have to fill those in. Otherwise your device won't be able to use the twitter API.
You need to create a new app on twitter.com. Then use the provided API keys to 
configure this node.

== Transitioning to other packages

This package is obsolete now as it  didn't really integrate into any other
packages. The Schedule Player package offers a better option to show tweets
and you can freely mix a our twitter content with other content. Have
